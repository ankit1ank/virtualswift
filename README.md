# virtualswift - Swift virtual environment builder.

Virtualswift is a tool for creating isolated 'virtual' swift environments.

If you are familiar with python, then virtualswift is to swift what virtualenv is to python.

## Prerequisites

#### On Ubuntu
You need all dependencies required for the swift language and wget.
The following command should install everything:
`sudo apt-get install clang libicu-dev wget`

#### On Mac
You need to install xcode required by the version of swift you intend to use.
See xcode and macOS versions required for each release of swift [here.](https://swift.org/download/#using-downloads)

As of now, if you have xcode 9 beta or later, you can install only swift 4. I have not figured out a workaround for running multiple versions of swift in different virtual environments on a mac machine. However, on ubuntu you can run different versions of swift in different virtual environments.
